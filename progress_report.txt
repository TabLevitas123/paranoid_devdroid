# Agent Swarm System Progress Report

## Completed Components:

### 1. Marvin's Orchestration System
- **Marvin** is the central agent who orchestrates the entire swarm of sub-agents.
- Marvin can receive tasks, process them, and decide how to delegate work to the following sub-agents:
    - **Hallucination Monitor**: Detects hallucinations and warns Marvin if the task shows signs of inconsistency.
    - **Roastmaster**: Critiques decisions with humorous feedback to force better agent decisions.
    - **Verification Agent**: Fact-checks the task using APIs or web scraping and provides verification results.
    - **Expert Panel**: A panel of agents modeled after real-world experts who deliberate on complex tasks and offer decisions based on expertise.
- All decisions are communicated between agents using the **Communication Protocol**, which tracks and logs messages.

### 2. Flask Web Interface Integration
- The Flask application is set up with a user interface where users can submit tasks.
- Marvin processes the tasks using his sub-agents and returns the final decision to the user via the web interface.
- The Flask app is fully integrated with Marvin's orchestration system, allowing real-time task submission and decision-making.

### 3. Core Agent Classes
- The **Agent Base Class** provides the foundation for all agents, including the ability to create sub-agents, communicate, and handle tasks.
- **Hallucination Monitor** detects and flags strange behavior.
- **Roastmaster** critiques bad decisions in a humorous way to push for better outcomes.
- **Verification Agent** checks the validity of decisions using APIs and web scraping.
- **Expert Panel** includes expert agents (e.g., Dr. Ada Lovelace, Nikola Tesla) who deliberate and provide a consensus on complex problems.

### 4. Communication Protocol
- A dedicated communication system between agents to log messages and share decision-making results.
- This keeps agents in sync and allows them to relay information back to Marvin for the final decision.

## What Still Needs to Be Done:

### 1. **UI Enhancements**
- Implement a more detailed front-end for displaying task progress, agent decisions, and communication logs.
- Add features such as dark mode, advanced task scheduling, and prioritization options for users.
  
### 2. **Efficiency vs Accuracy Tiers**
- Implement the **efficiency vs accuracy** levels that Marvin can toggle between:
    - Level 1: Maximum efficiency (minimal verification and hallucination monitoring).
    - Level 5: Maximum accuracy (more verifiers, monitors, and sub-agents).

### 3. **Sub-Agent Creation Based on Task Complexity**
- Develop logic for Marvin to dynamically create additional sub-agents based on task complexity (e.g., splitting tasks into sub-tasks).
- Allow agents to create their own sub-agents if necessary.

### 4. **Task Optimization and Learning**
- Introduce machine learning or reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning) to improve decision-making over time.
- Use data from previous tasks to make more informed decisions and optimize agent efficiency.

### 5. **Advanced Logging and Analytics**
- Expand logging functionality to track agent performance, task completion times, and resource usage.
- Develop a dashboard for monitoring the system's overall performance.

### 6. **Security Features**
- Add encryption and security measures for task data and agent communication.
- Implement user authentication and access control for submitting tasks.

### 7. **Social Media and Email Integration**
- Expand Marvin's capabilities to include control over social media accounts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Discord) and automated email response generation.

### 8. **API Key Management**
- Improve API key management (e.g., rotate keys, manage API quotas) for the agents that rely on external services.
- Add additional APIs for fact-checking and scraping data.

### Conclusion:
The foundation of Marvin's **Agent Swarm** system is now solid, with key agents in place, task delegation functioning, and a working Flask interface for user interaction. The next steps involve enhancing the system with more advanced features, security, and real-time optimization.
